Track 1: ngrok Challenge
You are the alien leader of an advancing invasion fleet, and your species has catalogued thousands of intelligent life forms across the galaxy for strategic assessment.
You are tasked with implementing a robust database API to store, retrieve, and filter alien species data.
You need to build a server to handle storing and retrieving alien data. The server should support:

GET /healthcheck
We will query this endpoint to determine if your server is alive and ready to receive connections.

POST /api/aliens
We will query this endpoint to send alien data. The alien model is DetailedAlien, outlined in the API specification, and the aliens will be sent in an array.

GET /api/aliens
We will query this endpoint to retrieve alien data. This should support the following filters as query parameters:
"spd_lte"
"spd_gte"
"atk_lte"
"atk_gte"
"hp_gte"
"hp_lte"
"type"

DELETE /api/aliens
We will query this endpoint at the beginning of every test to clear your alien data. This is on setup, not on teardown.

To submit your attempt, expose your server using ngrok and submit that URL. Read the ngrok documentation here:
